This is the project dedicated to NLP. Here are the tasks for the project:
1. Download Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll from Project Gutenberg's website http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt
2. Perform any necessary preprocessing on the text, including converting to lower case, removing stop words, numbers / non-alphabetic characters, lemmatization.
3. Find Top 10 most important (for example, in terms of TF-IDF metric) words from each chapter in the text (not "Alice"); how would you name each chapter according to the identified tokens?
4. Find the Top 10 most used verbs in sentences with Alice. What does Alice do most often?
